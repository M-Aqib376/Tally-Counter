Tally Counter is a simple Python application built with Tkinter,
 allowing users to count events easily. Users can increase the count,
 reset it (with an undo option), save the count with the current date, 
and view all previously saved counts. It is user-friendly and stores
 data in a JSON file. To run it, ensure Python is installed and execute
 the script using python tally_counter.py.
